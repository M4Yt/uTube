µTube
=====

### What is µTube?
µTube is an application for managing subscriptions on YouTube without needing a Google+ account.

### Getting started
Set up a HTTP server, clone the repository and open it in a webbrowser.

If you have no idea what all of that means, then [click here](http://polyfloyd.github.io/uTube/).

To add a channel, click in the list-icon thinghy in the top-right of the screen and mash the channelname in the textbox.
You need a channelname, e.g "LuminosityEvents". Stuff like "UCi4JeT_3WuhXKOqfcOp9-Sw" will not work. You can find the channelname in the URL of the channel e.g. "https://www.youtube.com/user/LuminosityEvents".

### Troubleshooting
If something doesn't work, try some of the following:

 *  Use another browser. I only tested this in Firefox and Chromium.
 *  Disable NoScript, Request Policy and whatnot.
